### ✨ Hi, I'm Wren 🪶 ✨

#### 🔭 _I'm looking for Front-End and Full-Stack roles, feel free to reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wren-hawthorne/)!_

#### 🏗️ Side projects I'm tinkering with
  - [OctoLooper](https://github.com/wrenhawth/octo-looper): A prototype tool for generating musical loops, created for an Educational Technology course to teach children music theory concepts through composition. Designed to be cute, child-friendly, and approachable to empower children of young ages to create their own musical work.
  - [React Sketches](https://github.com/wrenhawth/react_sketches): A place for me to put smaller one-off projects, including a color palette generator 🎨
  - (upcoming) I'm designing some fun musical experiments with [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/) to develop my Web Audio skills

### 🌱 Skills that I'm learning and growing
  - [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) to develop games and interactive art experiences 👾
  - [Cognitive Science](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6795-introduction-cognitive-science) as part of my Human-Computer Interaction specialization through Georgia Tech's [OMSCS program](https://omscs.gatech.edu/)
    
#### 📚 I'm currently working my way through
  - [The Rust Programming Language](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/) (the experimental [interactive version](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/experiment-intro.html)) 🦀
  - [Designing Data-Intesive Applications](https://dataintensive.net/) by Martin Kleppmann ⚙️
  - Learning enough Japanese to pass the [JPLT N3](https://www.jlpt.jp/e/about/levelsummary.html) next year 🈴
